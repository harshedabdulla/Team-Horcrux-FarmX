WORK FLOW 


IMAGE PROCESSING 
•	Using OpenCV, Image processing of a leaf from the plant is done.
•	If the leaf is a full green leaf, it is said to be healthy and sector is shown in green.
•	If the leaf is yellow, the plant has irrigation problems and sector is shown in orange.
•	If brown or black spots are found in the leaf the plant is said to have a plant disease and sector is shown in red.
•	Image processing is used to rate the crop on the basis of the quality of leaves which is used for calculating the optimum moisture.





OPTIMUM MOISTURE CALCULATION
 
•	Using a sensor, the moisture in the soil is recorded at that particular temperature and humidity.
•	Optimum value of moisture of the soil at that particular temperature and humidity is calculated for a specific plant 
•	Found by storing, monitoring and processing the data from all the previous readings of the plant.
•	A motor of the irrigation system turns on and provides the required water to the plant if recorded moisture is less than optimum.




USER-INTERFACE
    
•	Makes the farmer notice the areas where there are irrigation problems and spreading diseases.
•	Facilitates the farmer to monitor all parts of the field at a glance
•	Helps him to selectively give more attention to the problematic areas.
•	Helps the farmer to taken timely action to protect the crops
•	Aids the efficient use of resources.
