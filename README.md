•	Using OpenCV, Image processing of a leaf from the plant is done.
•	If the leaf is a full green leaf, it is said to be healthy and sector is shown in green.
•	If the leaf is yellow, the plant has irrigation problems and sector is shown in orange.
•	If brown or black spots are found in the leaf the plant is said to have a plant disease and sector is shown in red.
•	Image processing is used to rate the crop on the basis of the quality of leaves which is used for calculating the optimum moisture.





OPTIMUM MOISTURE CALCULATION

•	Using a sensor, the moisture in the soil is recorded at that particular temperature and humidity.
•	Optimum value of moisture of the soil at that particular temperature and humidity is calculated for a specific plant 
•	Found by storing, monitoring and processing the data from all the previous readings of the plant.
•	A motor of the irrigation system turns on and provides the required water to the plant if recorded moisture is less than optimum.




USER-INTERFACE
    
•	Makes the farmer notice the areas where there are irrigation problems and spreading diseases.
•	Facilitates the farmer to monitor all parts of the field at a glance
•	Helps him to selectively give more attention to the problematic areas.
•	Helps the farmer to taken timely action to protect the crops
•	Aids the efficient use of resources.

Source code for detection of plant leaves to classify the drone image shots into good and bad yield.

Drone images are shot and uploaded into the website to determine the quality of the yield.

Weather details and updates about farms can be accessed through this website.
